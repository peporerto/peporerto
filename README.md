I enjoy solving real business problems using:

- 🧱 **NestJS + SQL** for strong backend systems  
- ⚛️ **React** for interactive, modern interfaces  
- ☁️ **AWS** for secure, efficient cloud deployment  
- 🤖 **AI / LLMs** for smarter applications  
- 🛠️ **DevOps basics** for automation and CI/CD  

I'm self-taught, detail-oriented, and I love building real products from scratch.
